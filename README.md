# Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining: homework 1

This repository is designed to contain files releted to the first homework of our course.

Firstly, there is a folder (*stamps*) which includes a file called *Submissions.pdf* that consists of a list of all my submitted exercises with their results and scores. The exercises are available on https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard and they are about basics of coding in python.

Then, there is a second file, a Jupyter Notebook, named *scripts.ipynb*. It provides the Python codes of my solutions of the two problems of the homework divided in sections.
