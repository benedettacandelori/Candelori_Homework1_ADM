# Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining: homework 1

This repository is designed to contain two files releted to the first homework of our course.

One of these two which is called *Submissions.pdf* consists of a list of all my submitted exercises with their results and scores. The exercises are available on https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard and they are about basics of coding in python.

The second file is a Jupyter Notebook and it is named *Homework1.ipynb*. It provides the Python codes of my solutions of the two problems of the homework divided in sections.
